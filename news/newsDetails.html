    <p>Bombs were detonated simultaneously at 11 gas stations in southern Thailand, apparently in an attack aimed at disrupting local elections."The bombs were detonated almost at the same time. A group of people planted explosives to damage the gas pumps," Boonchauy Homyamyen, governor of Narathiwat province in southern Thailand, said today.The Thai military said the bombs exploded within 40 minutes after midnight, setting fires at 11 gas stations across the southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala. Four people were injured, including a firefighter and two gas station employees in Pattani province.</p>
    <p>All four people were taken to the hospital and none were seriously injured. It is unclear who was behind the attack, and authorities have not yet arrested any suspects.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said security officials believe the bombings were planned to coincide with the local government elections, and were not an attack by insurgents.The commander of the Thai army in the south, Narathip Phoynok, ordered security measures to be raised to "the maximum level in all areas," including traffic and border checkpoints.</p>
